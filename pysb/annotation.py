class Annotation(object):

    """
    A lightweight annotation mechanism for model elements.

    Based loosely on MIRIAM (http://co.mbine.org/standards/miriam) which is in
    turn based on RDF. An Annotation is equivalent to an RDF triple.

    This is still an experimental feature!

    Parameters
    ----------
    subject
        Element to annotate, typically a Component.
    object_
        Annotation, typically a string containing an identifiers.org URL.
    predicate : string, optional
        Relationship of `object_` to `subject`, typically a string containing a
        biomodels.net qualifier. If not specified, defaults to 'is'.
